# Chemical identifiers for the molecule serving as a unique identifier
  # The identifier.org prefix is used to look up the identifier in the 
  # identifiers.org database.
  # The value is the unique identifier for the molecule in that database
  # For example, pubchem.compound: 5497103 means that the molecule can be 
  # found at https://identifiers.org/pubchem.compound/5497103
  # The identifiers are used to link the molecule to other databases and resources
  # All identifier fields are optional, but at least one should be provided.
